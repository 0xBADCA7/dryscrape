# Overview

**Author:** Niklas Baumstark

dryscrape is a lightweight web scraping library for Python. It uses a 
headless Webkit instance to evaluate Javascript on the visited pages. This 
enables painless scraping of plain web pages as well as Javascript-heavy 
“Web 2.0” applications like
Facebook.

It is built on the shoulders of
[capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)'s 
[webkit-server](https://github.com/niklasb/webkit-server). A big thanks goes 
to thoughtbot, inc. for building this excellent piece of software!
